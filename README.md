# `PLAY NINE`

## `1. Synopsis`
Play nine is a reactweb application that lets you choose a number out of nine that equals to the total number of randonly generated stars.

Once a number is picked, it is marked as selected and hence unavailable for use unless the player redraws the game. A player can only redraw 5 times. Upon which, if he loses/ wins the player gets a message telling him that he lost/won the game. There's a play again button that lets the player play the game once more.            |
